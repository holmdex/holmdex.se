<h3>📘 How to Use This Information</h3>

<h4>📊 What the Numbers Mean</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Average Return:</strong> The average percentage change for that weekday over 10 years.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive Days:</strong> How often that day ended with a gain rather than a loss.</li>
  <li><strong>Green = Better, Red = Worse:</strong> Bars are colored from red to green based on performance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>📐 How the Weekday Pattern Math Works – Simplified</h4>

<h5>📅 Daily Return Calculation</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Take today's closing price and divide by yesterday's closing price</li>
  <li>Subtract 1 from this number</li>
  <li>Multiply by 100 to get percentage return</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Example:</em> If a stock closed at $105 today and $100 yesterday:<br>
(105 ÷ 100) – 1 = 0.05 → 0.05 × 100 = <strong>5%</strong> daily return</p>

<h5>📆 Weekday Analysis</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Group all returns by weekday (all Mondays together, all Tuesdays, etc.)</li>
  <li>For each group, calculate:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Average Return:</strong> Sum of all returns ÷ number of days</li>
      <li><strong>Percentage of Positive Days:</strong> Days with gains ÷ total days</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>🚫 Removing Outliers</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Measure how far each return is from the average (in standard deviations)</li>
  <li>Remove returns more than 3 standard deviations from the mean</li>
  <li>This filters extreme events like crashes or spikes</li>
</ol>

<h5>🎨 Color Mapping</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the highest and lowest average weekday returns</li>
  <li>Create a red-to-green gradient scale</li>
  <li>Map each weekday onto that scale for intuitive visual insights</li>
</ol>

<p>📊 This structured method ensures results are statistically valid and visually meaningful across thousands of trading days, offering real-world insights into subtle but persistent weekday effects.</p>

<h4>📈 Why These Small Differences Matter</h4>
<p>Weekday-based return differences may look small (often less than 0.2%), but their impact can be significant when combined with consistency and time:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>📈 Compounding Effect:</strong> Small advantages add up dramatically over years of investing.</li>
  <li><strong>🔁 Consistency:</strong> A pattern that repeats every week can present ongoing opportunities.</li>
  <li><strong>🛡️ Risk Reduction:</strong> Knowing which days tend to be weaker can help you better manage volatility.</li>
</ul>

<h4>📊 Statistical Interpretation</h4>
<p>The key insight from this analysis is that even small differences in average returns can be statistically significant when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sample size is large (thousands of trading days)</li>
  <li>The pattern is consistent across multiple markets</li>
  <li>The effect persists over long time periods</li>
</ul>
<p>This is based on the <strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong>, which states that with a large enough sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution regardless of the population's distribution.</p>
<p>By compounding these small percentage differences over many years, the cumulative effect on investment returns can be substantial. For example, a 0.1% advantage, compounded weekly over a 10-year period, would yield approximately <strong>5% more total return</strong> compared to a random day strategy.</p>
<p>This is the mathematical basis for why the weekday effect, while small in daily terms, can be meaningful for long-term investment strategies.</p>

<h4>🛠️ Practical Ways to Apply This Knowledge</h4>
<p>If you’re a regular investor who makes monthly contributions to savings or investments:</p>

<h5>✅ DO</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Schedule Regular Investments:</strong> Consider setting up your automatic investments to happen on historically stronger days.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan Monthly Contributions:</strong> If you invest monthly in index funds or ETFs, choosing better-performing weekdays could improve long-term results.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> The real power comes from applying this pattern consistently over many years.</li>
</ul>

<h5>❌ DON’T</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t Use for Short-Term Trading:</strong> These are long-term patterns, not day-trading signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t Expect Guarantees:</strong> Past patterns don’t guarantee future results.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t Invest Based Only on Weekday:</strong> This should be just one small factor in your investment decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>💬 Final Thought:</strong> Smart investing is about consistent, small improvements over time. Choosing a statistically better weekday for your regular investments is a simple tweak that could boost your long-term returns without requiring any additional money or risk.</p>
